This module takes in either Monte Carlos files or real data file (.dat)and decode the raw FED data from those files
In DPGAnalysis-SiPixelTools/MCHitAnalyzer/plugins/, there is a file named MCHitAnalyzer.cc which is my EDAnalyzer that I wrote base on Nik's code. What it does is decoding the raw data from the .root or .dat file and write the decoded raw data into a .root file. It also finds the FED with the highest number of hits and output that at the end of the program. In the /MCHitAnalyzer/python/ , there are Sim-Out-Config.py and Raw-Out-Config.py. The former is used for running my EDAnalyzer with Monte Carlos .root file, the latter is for running it with raw data files (.dat)
